# BleExplorer 

This will become a simple BLE discoverer app, based on a [starter-mobile](https://github.com/paulcbetts/starter-mobile)
project. Under the hood one can find Xamarin.Forms and ReactiveUI.

Hopefully this will show how to Do It Rightâ„¢.

## The project structure

1. BleExplorer-Android: The main Android app project.
1. BleExplorer-iOS: The main iOS (both iPhone and iPad) application project.
1. BleExplorer-Core: Code that is shared between the two projects. This project
   also has Xamarin.Forms set up and ready to go.
